            <h2>
                <b>History</b>
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a result of the decree 213/GD signed by President Ngô Đình Diệm on 29 Jun 1957, the university was known as the National Center of Technology (also known as Phu Tho National Center of Technology). The centre included four partner colleges: College of Civil Engineering, College of Electrical Engineering, College of Industrial Arts Engineering (École Supérieure d'Ingénieurs des Arts Industriels - Kỹ sư Công nghệ) and Vietnam National Maritime Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1972, the National Center of Technology has been renamed the National Institute of Technology, which was the only centre in South Vietnam to train technical engineers and subject matter experts. According to decree 010/SL/VNGDTN signed on 11 January 1974, the National Institute of Technology was merged into the Thu Duc Institute of Technology and renamed the University of Technology. Thanh Hoa Postgraduate Department (the current Environmental Engineering Faculty) was established in the same year. This was the first time when the university conducted its post-graduate training programme. After the national reunification, the university was renamed the Ho Chi Minh University of Technology as Saigon was renamed to Ho Chi Minh City (according to Decision 426/TTg signed by the President of the Cabinet on 27 October 1976). Being one of the three largest universities of technology in Vietnam, the Ho Chi Minh University of Technology has the mission of training engineers majoring in the fields of capital construction, industry, resources exploration and exploitation, and environmental preservation to provide a force of manpower mainly for the southern areas of Vietnam.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of 1981, HCMUT has expanded its scope to include postgraduate training as well. It was in 1990 that HCMUT opened its master's degree training system for students. Since 1981, the postgraduate training in HCMUT has been geared towards a specialised group of students.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to decision 16/CP by the Prime Minister on 17 January 1995, the Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) was founded. The Ho Chi Minh University of Technology became one of the 9 members of VNU-HCM and was renamed the University of Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to decision 15/2001/QĐ-TTg and decision 16/2001/QĐ-TTg by The Prime Minister on 2 December 2001, the Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City was reorganised with only 3 members; and the University of Engineering gained back its traditional name as Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The total area of my uni is 41,23 ha with morden buildings and trees. The main campus of both ly Thuong Kiet and Di An is the best place for team building, club activities and special events, etc...
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of my school's buildings includes not only regular classrooms but also laboratories and offices specify for one percific faculty. Such as, the bulding BKB6, which is located at Di An campus is specify for faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, in charge of managing student who study CS and CE.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the gap between two campuses is sometime the problem to me since it takes me average 1 hour of driving everyday. One campus is located at Ly Thuong Kiet street-district 10-Ho Chi Minh city, another is at Di An province and there are 25 kilometers of highway between them.
            </p>
